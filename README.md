# horiseon-code-refractor

code refractor of the existing website to improve accessibility/markdown &amp; condense code.

## Description

For this project, I will be tackling the current Horiseon website in order to identify key changes for improvement, including but not limited to adding "alt" tags for improved accesibility, improving the semantic markdown of the code, and condensing sections of the css in order to cut out redundancies and reorganize the structure to better reflect the flow of the website.

Into today's age, almost every single person on the planet has access to the internet. This also includes individuals with disabilities and older technologies. It is imperative that every website and application follow proper accesibility standards in order to accomodate these groups of people. Not only will improved accesibility give your website higher standing on search engines like Google, but it could also reduce the parent site's chance of lawsuits. 

Additionally, it is extremely important to improve one's code to reflect the ever changing dynamics of the internet. For this reason, I will be refractoring the semantic markdown to better improve the flow and understanding of the html code, as well as the struture of the css elements. Without proper markdown and organization, it can become extremely confusing for fellow programmers to read and improve the website's dynamics.
