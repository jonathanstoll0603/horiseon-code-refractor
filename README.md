# horiseon-code-refractor

code refractor of the existing website to improve accessibility/markdown &amp; condense code.

## Description

For this project, I will be tackling the current Horiseon website in order to identify key changes for improvement, including but not limited to adding "alt" tags for improved accesibility, improving the semantic markdown of the code, and condensing sections of the css in order to cut out redundancies and reorganize the structure to better reflect the flow of the website.

Into today's age, almost every single person on the planet has access to the internet. This also includes individuals with disabilities and older technologies. It is imperative that every website and application follow proper accesibility standards in order to accomodate these groups of people. Not only will improved accesibility give your website higher standing on search engines like Google, but it could also reduce the parent site's chance of lawsuits. 

Throughout this project, I learned how critical it is to improve one's existing code in order to reflect the ever changing ecosystem of the internet. While researching a broad range of material that assisted in explaining semantic markdown, I was made aware of a few new tags being widely used today. A few of these tags include the <header> and <nav> elements that clearly show a developer where the code containing the header and navigation sections belong. Additionally, body tags such as <main>, <section>, <aside>, and <article> do a more efficient job of breaking the site into easily digestible pieces. 

By the end of this project, I had a vastly better idea of how to improve the flow and understanding of my html code, as well as the organization of the css elements. Without proper markdown, structure, and notes to fellow developers, it can become extremely confusing for another person on the team to follow and adapt to a website's dynamics.
